* Introduction
  This manual details the configuration/workflow process to be
  followed for Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition. The College Cloud
  machine/server will be running without GUI. GUI has been disabled
  for better performance results.  

  Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition
  is the Portable-Edition for Virtual Labs. It offers the offline
  version of Virtual labs, experiments and theoretical content. This
  edition addresses the lack of internet access or poor internet
  connectivity across different institutes/colleges. It results in a
  very cost-effective Learning Management System.


* Requirements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: requirements
  :END:    

  1. College Cloud System Configuration (recommended) 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
      RAM : 16 GB 
      SMPS : 600 W 
      CPUs: 8
      MotherBoard wattage: 77 W 
     #+END_EXAMPLE
  2. 500 GB SATA  ( Hard Disk Drive - HDD)- College Cloud Edition
  3. WiFi Router
  4. Computer Lab with at least 30-50 Systems/Desktops.
  5. Network Switch Input, from where all the labs would obtain DHCP
     IP) to Computer Lab machines/Desktops. This would make College
     Cloud accessible over the LAN network providing better results.
  6. System Administrator with basic knowledge of CentOS operating systems and
     networking.
    

* Configuring College Cloud Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: cc-server
  :END:    

  1. Configure WiFi-Router ::  Router would need to serve 10.2.57.0/24
       to its clients. This would need configuration of LAN settings
       in the router such that router's dhcp server would serve IPs
       from the above IP range to its clients.

       - NOTE 1 :: Configuration of Wifi router would be
                   different from router to router. Because
                   of this reason, steps are not updated
                   here in this document.

       - NOTE 2 :: In network terminology, 10.2.57.0/24
                    means a network range from 10.2.57.0 to
                    10.2.57.255.
       - NOTE 3 :: While configuring router, 10.2.57.1 IP
                   has to be given to the wifi router. This
                   is needed because to access or configure
                   wifi router again in future if necessary
                   by browsing this ip in the browser.
       
       - NOTE 4 :: During Wi-Fi router configuration, DNS
                   server should be 10.2.57.62.* *Adding DNS
                   server ip, varies from router to
                   router. For example*,
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       primary DNS 10.2.57.62
       or
       DNS1        10.2.57.62
       or 
       nameserver  10.2.57.62
       or
       domain name 10.2.57.62
       #+END_EXAMPLE
       
  2. Connect the identified College Cloud machine to the
     configured Wi-Fi router through a LAN cable. *Please do
     not touch the WAN port*. 

     - NOTE :: WAN port is a "Wide Area Network".  In
               general, while configuring Wifi router, this
               port is needed in order to provide Internet
               connection to its connected clients.  But for
               College Cloud server setup, Internet is not
               in the scope, so ignore the port.

  3. Connect the College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive to the
     identified College Cloud machine.
  4. Boot the machine from College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive.
  5. Please use [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default linux user credentials]] to login.
     + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
               first login . To change the password, follow the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][link]]
** Launch Virtual Labs (Open edX) platform
   1. Run the following command on terminal to run Virtual Labs on Open
      edX platform. This may take a few minutes to launch
      the platform.
      
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       cd vagrant-boxes
       vagrant-boxes$vagrant up     #Look for Vagrant file in "vlabs" account and run this command
       vagrant-boxes$vagrant up --provision       
       #+END_EXAMPLE
      If the output of both the commands throws like below,
      please ignore, that are warnings only and not major
      errors.
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       Warning: vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
       because the filesystem "vboxsf" is not available. This filesystem is
       made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
       Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
       guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
       Vagrant box. For context, the command attempted was:
       
       mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 vagrant /vagrant
       
       The error output from the command was:
       #+END_EXAMPLE
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       vlabs_platform: stdin: is not a tty
       #+END_EXAMPLE

      - vagrant :: Vagrant is a tool for building and
                   managing virtual machine environments
   2. College Cloud edition of Virtual Labs is now ready for use.
   3. [[./installation-manual.org::#instructions][Follow the instructions]] to access vlabs.ac.in page
   4. Access the vlabs.ac.in page, at this time no lab simulations
      would be accessible. To access the simulations of the labs,
      first understand [[./installation-manual.org::#using-cc-server][Using College Cloud Edition]]

   disciplines and domains. It is adviced to have upto a maximum of 5
   Labs running at any given time. All other labs will be visible on
   Lab Catalogue.  To allow the students to use the Labs that were
   [[Starting Lab containers][started]] on the OpenVZ web panel, follow the steps given below -
  
   1. Visit http://vlabs.ac.in:18010/ to open Studio of College Cloud
      Edition.
   2. Login using [[Passwords][admin credentials]] .

      at a time.
   2. It is adviced to have upto a maximum of 5 Labs running at any
      given time.
   3. The best choice would be start one lab at a time and have
      maximum of 10 labs running at any given instance.
